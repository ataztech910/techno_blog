# techno_blog_extension

This is an opensource solution for my chrome extension that you can get here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manager-for-telegraph/mkpbnggpapchbnjbgjkanokmdgblcphd
The idea is to provide a possibility to authorize and work with telegra.ph blogging system from your brouser using UI instead a bot in Telegram
The project is in beta stage and not contain all possible and planned features
